## 1. Easy Test

### Problem Statement

Download data from [https://lftdi.camden.rutgers.edu/provedit/files/](https://lftdi.camden.rutgers.edu/provedit/files/) then use `seqinr::read.abif` to read and `seqinr::plotabif` to plot an fsa file.

First, I downloaded data from the given link. Then I installed the current version of `seqinr` package, which is used for biological sequences retrieval and analysis. In the following code, I used `seqinr::read.abif()` to read the fsa file(data) and then I plot the data extracted using `seqinr::plotabif()`.
